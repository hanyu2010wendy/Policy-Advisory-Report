### Abstract
The education on green development concepts in Jiangxi began relatively early, helping our province grow into a national ecological civilization experimental zone and becoming an ideal model for "Beautiful China" as envisioned by General Secretary Xi Jinping. However, a dedicated educational system focused on green development has yet to be established. It is suggested that our province learn from Finland's successful experiences and, in line with the requirements for green emergence, develop a green development education plan based on the existing sustainable development education framework. This includes establishing a green development education system; promoting awareness of green development from early childhood; integrating elementary and secondary education to instill green development concepts in youth; vigorously advancing vocational education to cultivate applied talents suited for green development; and fully promoting higher education to meet the new demands of Jiangxi's green emergence. This aims to create a "Jiangxi model" for green development education, paving the way for the nation to lead in green development education.
### Introduction
Jiangxi is fully implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important directives for creating a "Jiangxi model" of Beautiful China, as well as the central government's major deployments regarding ecological civilization construction and green development. We are exploring a "Jiangxi model" for ecological civilization and green development. In this context, establishing a "Jiangxi model" for green development education will pioneer green development education in our country. This initiative not only supports our province's deep implementation of the strategy to strengthen education but also aligns with our "twenty-four-character" guideline of "innovation-driven, reform-oriented, open-enhancement, green emergence, responsibility and pragmatism, and enriching the people of Jiangxi." It further facilitates the realization of the grand vision for a prosperous, beautiful, and happy modern Jiangxi, while promoting China's wisdom and experience in "green development" as a global leader. We present this research report for your review.
